Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' 
for details.
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

每个人都可以复制和分发本许可证文件的逐字副本
，但不允许对其进行更改。
序言
大多数软件的许可证旨在剥夺您共享和更改它的自由。相比之下，GNU 通用公共许可证旨在保证您共享和更改自由软件的自由——确保软件对所有用户都是免费的。本通用公共许可证适用于大多数自由软件基金会的软件以及作者承诺使用它的任何其他程序。（其他一些自由软件基金会软件则受 GNU 宽通用公共许可证的保护。）您也可以将其应用于您的程序。

当我们谈到自由软件时，我们指的是自由，而不是价格。我们的通用公共许可证旨在确保您可以自由分发免费软件的副本（如果您愿意，可以收取这项服务的费用），您可以收到源代码或可以在需要时获得源代码，您可以更改软件或在新的免费程序中使用软件的某些部分；并且您知道您可以做这些事情。

为了保护您的权利，我们需要制定限制，禁止任何人拒绝您的这些权利或要求您放弃这些权利。如果您分发软件的副本或修改软件，这些限制将转化为您的某些责任。

例如，如果您分发此类程序的副本，无论是免费还是收费，您都必须向接收者提供您拥有的所有权利。您必须确保他们也能收到或可以获得源代码。并且您必须向他们展示这些条款，以便他们了解自己的权利。

我们通过两个步骤保护您的权利：（1）对软件进行版权保护，（2）向您提供此许可证，该许可证授予您复制、分发和/或修改软件的合法权限。

此外，为了保护每位作者和我们自己，我们希望确保每个人都明白，此免费软件没有任何保证。如果软件被其他人修改并传播出去，我们希望接收者知道他们拥有的不是原版，这样其他人引入的任何问题都不会影响原作者的声誉。

最后，任何免费程序都不断受到软件专利的威胁。我们希望避免自由程序的再分发者单独获得专利许可的危险，这实际上使程序专有。为了防止这种情况，我们已明确规定，任何专利都必须获得许可，供所有人免费使用，否则根本不予许可。

以下是复制、分发和修改的确切条款和条件。

复制、分发和修改的条款和条件
0. 本许可证适用于任何程序或其他作品，其中包含版权持有人发布的声明，声明可以根据本通用公共许可证的条款进行分发。下文中的“程序”指任何此类程序或作品，“基于程序的作品”指受版权法保护的程序或任何衍生作品：即包含程序或其部分的作品，可以是逐字的，也可以是经过修改和/或翻译成另一种语言的。（下文中，翻译不受“修改”一词的限制。）每个被许可人都被称为“您”。

除复制、分发和修改之外的活动不受本许可证的保护；它们不在本许可证的保护范围内。运行程序的行为不受限制，并且只有当程序的内容构成基于程序的作品（独立于通过运行程序而制作的作品）时，程序的输出才受保护。这是否属实取决于程序的作用。

1. 您可以以任何媒介复制和分发您收到的程序源代码的逐字副本，前提是您在每个副本上明显且适当地发布适当的版权声明和免责声明；保持所有提及本许可证和无任何担保的声明的完整性；并将本许可证的副本与本程序一起提供给本程序的任何其他接收者。

您可以对实际转让副本的行为收取费用，也可以选择以收费方式提供保修保护。

2. 您可以修改本程序的副本或其中任何部分，从而形成基于本程序的作品，并根据上述第 1 节的条款复制和分发此类修改或作品，前提是您还满足以下所有条件：

a) 您必须使修改后的文件带有明显的声明，说明您更改了文件以及任何更改的日期。

b) 您必须使您分发或发布的任何作品（全部或部分包含或衍生自本程序或其任何部分）作为整体免费许可给本许可证条款下的所有第三方。
c) 如果修改后的程序在运行时通常以交互方式读取命令，则您必须使其在以最普通的方式开始运行以进行此类交互使用时打印或显示一份声明，其中包括适当的版权声明和没有保证的声明（或者说您提供保证）以及用户可以在这些条件下重新分发程序，并告诉用户如何查看本许可证的副本。（例外：如果程序本身是交互式的，但通常不打印此类声明，则您基于该程序的作品无需打印声明。）
这些要求适用于整个修改后的作品。如果该作品的可识别部分不是从该程序衍生而来的，并且可以合理地被视为独立且单独的作品，那么当您将它们作为单独作品分发时，本许可证及其条款不适用于这些部分。但是，当您将相同的部分作为基于程序的作品整体的一部分进行分发时，整体的分发必须遵守本许可证的条款，该许可证对其他被许可人的许可扩展到整个整体，因此扩展到每个部分，无论谁编写了它。

因此，本节的目的不是主张权利或争夺您对完全由您编写的作品的权利；相反，其目的是行使控制基于程序的衍生作品或集体作品分发的权利。

此外，仅仅将另一部非基于程序的作品与程序（或基于程序的作品）聚合在存储或分发介质的卷上，并不会使另一部作品属于本许可证的范围。

3. 您可以根据上述第 1 和第 2 条的条款以目标代码或可执行形式复制和分发本程序（或根据第 2 条基于本程序的作品），但前提是您还必须执行以下操作之一：

a) 随附完整的相应机器可读源代码，该源代码必须根据上述第 1 和第 2 条的条款在通常用于软件交换的介质上分发；或者，
b) 随附一份有效期至少为三年的书面要约，以不超过您实际执行源代码分发的成本的价格向任何第三方提供完整的机器可读的相应源代码副本，该副本将根据上述第 1 和第 2 条的条款在通常用于软件交换的介质上分发；或者，
c) 随附您收到的有关分发相应源代码的要约的信息。 （此替代方案仅适用于非商业性分发，并且仅当您收到包含此类要约的目标代码或可执行形式的程序时才允许，符合上述第 b 小节的规定。）
作品的源代码是指对其进行修改的首选形式。对于可执行作品，完整源代码是指其包含的所有模块的所有源代码，以及任何相关的接口定义文件，以及用于控制可执行文件的编译和安装的脚本。但是，作为特殊例外，分发的源代码不必包括通常与可执行文件运行的操作系统的主要组件（编译器、内核等）一起分发的任何内容（以源代码或二进制形式），除非该组件本身随可执行文件一起分发。

如果通过提供从指定位置复制的访问权限来分发可执行文件或目标代码，则提供从同一位置复制源代码的等效访问权限也算作源代码的分发，即使第三方没有被强制将源代码与目标代码一起复制。

4. 除非本许可明确规定，否则您不得复制、修改、再授权或分发本程序。任何以其他方式复制、修改、再授权或分发本程序的尝试均属无效，并将自动终止您根据本许可所享有的权利。但是，根据本许可从您处获得副本或权利的各方只要完全遵守本许可，其许可就不会终止。

5. 您无需接受本许可，因为您尚未签署本许可。但是，没有任何其他内容授予您修改或分发本程序或其衍生作品的权限。如果您不接受本许可，则法律禁止这些行为。因此，通过修改或分发本程序（或基于本程序的任何作品），您表明您接受本许可，以及复制、分发或修改本程序或基于本程序的作品的所有条款和条件。

6. 每次您重新分发本程序（或基于本程序的任何作品）时，接收者都会自动从原始许可人处获得许可，以根据这些条款和条件复制、分发或修改本程序。您不得暗示不对接收者行使此处授予的权利施加任何进一步的限制。您不负责强制第三方遵守本许可证。

7. 如果由于法院判决或专利侵权指控或任何其他原因（不限于专利问题），对您施加的条件（无论是通过法院命令、协议还是其他方式）与本许可证的条件相抵触，则这些条件不会免除您遵守本许可证的条件。如果您无法以同时满足本许可证规定的义务和任何其他相关义务的方式进行分发，则您根本无法分发该程序。例如，如果专利许可证不允许所有直接或间接通过您收到副本的人免版税地重新分发该程序，那么您唯一能够同时满足该许可证和本许可证的方法就是完全不分发该程序。

如果本节的任何部分在任何特定情况下被认定为无效或不可执行，则本节的其余部分应适用，并且本节作为一个整体应在其他情况下适用。

本节的目的不是诱导您侵犯任何专利或其他财产权主张，或对任何此类主张的有效性提出异议；本节的唯一目的是保护由公共许可实践实施的自由软件分发系统的完整性。许多人依靠该系统的一致应用，为通过该系统分发的广泛软件做出了慷慨的贡献；是否愿意通过任何其他系统分发软件由作者/捐赠者决定，被许可人不能强加该选择。

本节旨在彻底阐明被认为是本许可证其余部分的结果。

8. 如果程序的分发和/或使用在某些国家/地区受到专利或版权界面的限制，则将程序置于本许可证之下的原始版权持有者可以添加明确的地理分发限制，排除这些国家/地区，以便仅允许在未被排除的国家/地区内或之间分发。在这种情况下，本许可证将纳入限制，就像写在本许可证的正文中一样。

9. 自由软件基金会可能会不时发布通用公共许可证的修订版和/或新版本。此类新版本在精神上与当前版本相似，但可能在细节上有所不同，以解决新问题或顾虑。

每个版本都有一个不同的版本号。如果程序指定了适用于它的本许可证的版本号和“任何后续版本”，您可以选择遵循该版本或自由软件基金会发布的任何后续版本的条款和条件。如果程序未指定本许可证的版本号，您可以选择自由软件基金会发布的任何版本。

10. 如果您希望将本程序的某些部分合并到其他分发条件不同的免费程序中，请写信给作者以征求许可。对于受自由软件基金会版权保护的软件，请写信给自由软件基金会；我们有时会对此做出例外。我们的决定将以两个目标为指导：维护我们所有免费软件衍生产品的自由状态，以及促进软件的共享和再利用。

无担保

11. 由于本程序是免费许可的，因此在适用法律允许的范围内，本程序不提供任何担保。除非另有书面说明，版权持有人和/或其他方均按“原样”提供本程序，不作任何明示或暗示的保证，包括但不限于适销性和特定用途适用性的暗示保证。程序质量和性能的全部风险由您承担。如果程序被证明存在缺陷，您应承担所有必要的服务、维修或更正的费用。

12. 除非适用法律要求或书面同意，任何版权持有人或任何可能按上述允许修改和/或重新分发本程序的其他方，在任何情况下均不对您承担任何损害赔偿责任，包括因使用或无法使用本程序而引起的任何一般、特殊、偶然或间接损害赔偿责任（包括但不限于数据丢失、数据变得不准确、您或第三方遭受的损失、或本程序无法与任何其他程序一起运行），即使该持有人或其他方已被告知此类损害的可能性。

条款和条件的结束
如何将这些条款应用于您的新程序
如果您开发了一个新程序，并且希望它对公众有最大的用处，那么最好的方法是实现此目的的方法是使其成为自由软件，每个人都可以根据这些条款重新分发和更改。

为此，请将以下声明附加到程序中。最安全的做法是将它们附加到每个源文件的开头，以最有效地传达免责条款；并且每个文件应至少包含“版权”行和指向完整声明所在位置的指针。

一行给出程序的名称和其功能。

本通用公共许可证不允许将您的程序合并到专有程序中。如果您的程序是子程序库，您可能会认为允许将专有应用程序与库链接更有用。如果这是您想要做的，请使用 GNU 宽通用公共许可证而不是本许可证。
